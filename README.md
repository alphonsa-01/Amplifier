# Amplifier
Modelling different types of amplifiers using classes

The input to the amplifier is the voltage VI and the output is the voltage VO. The output of an amplifier is proportional to the input. The constant of proportionality is called the “gain” of the amplifier.
Amplifier as base class and all different types of amplifiers as the derived classes.
